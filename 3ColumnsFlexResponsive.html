<h2>How online gender-based violence affects the safety of young women and girls</h2>

<div class="col-container">
  <div class="col" style="background:rgb(217, 125, 240)">
    <h2>Abuse online can lead young women to stay silent or even leave these spaces.</h2>
    <p>This happens when a young woman is both directly impacted by or witnesses abuse against someone else. Young women are 
      excited and curious when they begin exploring the online world, but this can quickly turn to shame and silence when they 
      face online abuse. As a result, many will think twice about what they post online, stop posting altogether or even close 
      their accounts. Young women who see others facing abuse online may also choose to limit their participation in these spaces. </p>

  <div class="col" style="background:rgb(163, 233, 169)">
    <h2>Reporting systems are not working well for many young women and LGBTQ+ youth.</h2>
    <p>Many participants noted that young women use terms or slang that moderation systems may not pick up. This is an even bigger challenge for 
      young women who speak different languages and dialects, or for LGBTQ+ youth whose terms for gender identity and self expression are dynamic 
      and ever-changing.</p>

    <h2> Young women online are particularly worried about abusive videos and images.</h2>
    <p>In our previous consultation, women in public life described how abusive images and videos threatened their credibility, but these were usually 
      in the form of doctored images or videos, like deepfakes. For young women, these threats more commonly took the form of non-consensual intimate 
      images (NCII). Other participants mentioned cases where perpetrators send young women sexually explicit images through direct messages.  As the 
      pandemic has driven more of our interactions online, participants and tech companies noted that there has been an increase in this kind of abuse. </p>
